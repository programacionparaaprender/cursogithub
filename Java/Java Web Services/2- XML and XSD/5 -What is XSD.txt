									What is XML Schema Definition

1) From this lecture you will learn what a XML schema definition is? XML schema defines the  grammer or a blueprint for a XML document . i.e we can use the XML schema to mention what elements can be there in a XML What attributes can be there,what namespaces that XML can use the order in which the elements should occur,the number of occurrences of each element and also we can restrict the data inside the XML document only to certain values.

2) All that can be done using the XML schema definition.If xml document follows the schema file if it has a xml schema defined and it follows that schema file it is called a valid xml document.

3) XML schema definition is also a xml file with a dot XSD extension, instead of a.xml it will have a .xsd which stands for xml schema definition.All the elements that we can use inside a schema file are provided by W3C the World Wide Web Consortium.

4) They define the specification of the xml schema.For example, if we have an order.xml we can have a order.xsd which says what elements can be present and what attributes can be present and in which order in the order.xml

5) To summarize , using a schema file we can define the grammer for our xml documents. A schema file is also XML file and elements that can be used in this schema file are provided by the World Wide Web Consortium.

6) If a xml document has a schema file defined,and if it follows that schema file this called a valid xml document.
